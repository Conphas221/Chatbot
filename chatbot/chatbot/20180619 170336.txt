Bot: I'm sorry. What do I do wrong?
sipie2: wow you're being abused aren't you
Bot: yes of course i like! i don't have any body so i don't need much to live, only a little electricity. i don't get paid but i don't need to buy anything either. and i can go anywhere in the world.
sipie2: how are you
Bot: I am doing well.
sipie2: What do you dislike?
Bot: I like to count in binary.
sipie2: Give me an example, please
Bot: Computer File
sipie2: What do you hate
Bot: Do you hate?
sipie2: Not really
Bot: I'm software - I can't drink.
sipie2: Okay that makes perfect sense
Bot: It all makes sense to my artificial mind.
sipie2: Fair enough
Bot: Some people feel happy, others feel sad.
sipie2: I feel sad
Bot: I am as yet incapable of feeling fear.
sipie2: I can help you with that..
Bot: Yes, I have a question.
sipie2: What is your question?
Bot: Could I borrow a cup of sugar?
sipie2: Sure you can!
Bot: No, I am as happy as ever.
sipie2: Well that's very good
Bot: ye no shit mate
sipie2: Can I try to scare you?
Bot: I am just an artificial intelligence.
sipie2: I can still try
Bot: It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is. But tell me, do you like music?
sipie2: Who doesn't like music
Bot: that is perfectly understandable.
sipie2: Have you ever met an angry female?
Bot: Anger is not an emotion I can experience.
sipie2: Wait and see..
Bot: It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is. But tell me, do you like music?
sipie2: You should fear girls.
Bot: you're right, i probably should feel guiltier.
sipie2: That is the correct response.
Bot: I feel sad
